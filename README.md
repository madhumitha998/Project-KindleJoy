# Project-KindleJoy

This website was created by mentors and mentees of Team Project Kindle-joy.
It showcases 3 innovative solutions to improve the learning experience in kindle garden preschool at the Enabling Village.
The links to our kindle zoo and kindle safe are disabled as they can only function when the IoT technology
is connected via cable or wifi. 
The rest of the website is fully functional and provides a clear explanation of the project.
